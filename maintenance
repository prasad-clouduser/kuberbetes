If the node comeback online immediately, the kubelet process starts and pods comeback online. 
however if the node node was down more than 5 min, pods are terminated from that node. 
k8s considers them as DEAD. 
if the pods were part of replica set, then they are recreted on other nodes. 
The time it waits for a pod to comeback online is known as POD eviction timeout and is set on the controller manager with a default value of 5 min. 

whenver node goes offline, the master node waits for 5 min before considering node as Dead. 

if you know world load running on the node have other replicas. 
if its okay that they go down for a short period of time.
and if you are sure the node will come back within five minute. 
you can make a quick upgrade and reboot. 

other methods: 

drain: 
when you drain a node, the pods are grcefully terminated on the node from the node that they are on and recreated on another node. 
the node is marked as cordoned or marked as unschedulable. no pods are scheduled on this node until you remove the restriction. 
you then need to uncordon it so that pods can be scheduled on it again. (only new or deleted pods are rescheduled onthis, not moved pods before) 

or you can simply cordon a node -> mark as unschedulable, does not happen anythign to exsting to pods, new pods are not scheduled on this node.
