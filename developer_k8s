STATEFULSET: 

1. in deployment all PODs part of the deployent come up at the sametime. 
Slaves pointing to the address that does not exist. Replication between master and slaves gets affected. 
Dploymnet creates the pods with random name. 
stateful sets similar to deployments. 

in stateful sets pods are creatd in a sequential order. 
after the first pod is deployed, it must be in a running state amd ready state before the next pod is deployed. 
that helps us to dploy the master first and then slave1 and slave2.   

================================================================================================================================

ordered, graceful deployment. 
Each pod gets a stable, unique DNS record on the network that any other application can use to access a pod. 
podManagementPolicy property to instrcut the stateful set not follow the ordered approach. deploy them parallel. 

================================================================

Headless service: 

1. we can't use the IP address of mysql in webserver pod. 
2. pod dns address created from IP address, we can't use it either. 
3. what we need is a service that does not load balance the requests but gives us a DNS entry to reach each pod. 

headless service is created like a normal service, it does not have a IP address of its own. 
it does not perform any load balancing. 
All it does is create DNS entries for each pod using the pod name and a sub domain. 
webserver points to the master pod now (mysql-0.mysql-h.default.svc.cloud.local) 
diff between headless service and normal service --> setting clusterIP to None to headless service. 

Deplolyment scenario
under spec section of mysql pod definition, you must specify subDomain and hostname property to create a DNS record for each pod. 
this way it creates the duplicate records of DNS which is not useful at all. 
thats where stateful set differ from deployment. 

remove subdomaiin and hostname property and just keep serviceName field, 
the stateful set automatically assign the right host name for each pod, based on pod name and it automatically assigns the right subdomain.


================================================================================================

Storage in statefulset: 

All pods created by stateful set tries to use the same volume (PVC)
mutiple pods or multiple instances of your application to share and access the same storage. 
thats how you configure it. and that also depends on the kind of volume created and provisioner are used. 

How to crate PVC automatically?
Instead of creating a PVC manually and then specifying it in the stateful set def file. 
storage class provisions a volume on GCP and then creates a PVC and associates the PV with volume and binds the PVC to the PV.
same process repeats for other pods of stateful set. 

staeteful set does not remove the PVC when restarted, it is reattached to same PVC and thus enable stabel storage for the pods. 

=============================================================================================================

Admission controllers: 

1. There are some kind of things that you can't achieve with existing role based access controls. 
2. administion controller helps us implement better security measures to enfore how a cluster is used. 
3. apart of validting config, it can change the request itself or perform addtional operations before the pod get created. 

There are built in administion controller available by default. 
You can also enable or disable the adminission control by default. 

it can change or mutate the object itself before it is created. this is called mutating admission controllers. 
Validate the request and allow or deny it -> vallidating admission controller. 

Webhook server need to be deployed in separate server or in own k8s cluster as deployment (then it should have service also) 
then webhook need to be configured with rules (when to execute) and lcation of webhook server. 

=====================================================================================

when you run the kubectl get deployment which version is the command going to query? thats defined by the preferredversion. 
if v1 is set to preferred version, then that is the command itwillquery. 

if multiple version are present, only one version can be storage version. 
this means if any object is created with the api version set to anything otherthan the storage version such as v1alpha1 or v1beta1 then those will be converted 
to the storage version V1 before storing them into the etcd database. 

storage version is the version in which an object is stored in etcd in respective of the version you have used in the yaml file while creating the object.
