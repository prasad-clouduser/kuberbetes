STATEFULSET: 

1. in deployment all PODs part of the deployent come up at the sametime. 
Slaves pointing to the address that does not exist. Replication between master and slaves gets affected. 
Dploymnet creates the pods with random name. 
stateful sets similar to deployments. 

in stateful sets pods are creatd in a sequential order. 
after the first pod is deployed, it must be in a running state amd ready state before the next pod is deployed. 
that helps us to dploy the master first and then slave1 and slave2.
