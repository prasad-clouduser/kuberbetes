Security: kubeconfig 
we can also pass the client certs to the kubectl utility. 
instead of cmd keep them in the config file.

KubeConfig: 

1. contexts marry these together (clusters and users) 
We are not configuring any kind of user access or authorization in the cluster with this process. 
you are using existing users with their existing privileges and defining what user you are going to use to access what cluster. 

that way you don't have to specify the user certificates and server address in each and every kubectl command you run. 

====================================================================

Kubernetes API: 

These APIs are responsible for cluster's functionality. 

/api -> core grup --> all core functionality 
/apis --> named group, more organized one. All newer features are made available through these named groups. 
all newer features are going to be made available through this new group. 

Apart of curl to access kube api server, we can also use kubectl proxy client to access k8s api server. 
it launches a proxy service locally on port 8001, and uses credentials and certificates from your kube config file to acecs the cluster. 
that way you dont have specify those in curl command. 

named apis --> it has API groups --> api groups have resources. 
each resource has actions assoicated with them.
