On windows you must rely on virtualization software like Hyper-v or VMWare workstation or virtual box to create linux VMs on which you can run k8s. 
There are other solutions also available to run k8s components as docker containers on windows VMs. Even then the docker images are linux based, and under the hoods they run on a small linux OS created by hyper-v 
for running linux docker containers. 

minikube -> relys on one of the virtualization software like oracle virtual box to create virtual machines that run the k8s cluster components. 

======================================================================================================

kube api server can be run in active active mode. 
If we have two API server on each master node,  you can have load balancer infront of master nodes that split traffic between API servers. 
kubectl utility point to that load balancer. nginx or ha proxy or any other load balancer for this purpose. 

scheduler and controller should run active and standby mode, otherwise results in more number of pods. 

Controller manager: 
when controller manager process is configured. you may specify the leader elect option which is by default set to true. 
with this option when controller manager process starts it tries to gain or lease a lock on an endpoint object in k8s named as kube controller manager endpoint. 
whichever process first updates the endpoint withits information gains the lease and becomes the active of two. 
it holds the lock for lease duration specified using the leader elect lease duration option. 
the active process renews the lease every 10 sec. 
both theprocesses try to become leader every 2 sec, second process can acquire the lock and become the leader. 
scheduler also same 

if etcd on the control plan node, if control node crashes, etcd also goes down. if it is on separate cluster, it won't go down. 
etcd; if any compoent want to reach, it can reach the etcd server at any of its instances. 
u can read and write data thorugh any of the available etcd server instances. thats why we specify the list of etcd server in kubeapi server config.
