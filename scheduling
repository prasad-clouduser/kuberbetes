1. the scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for thse that dont have this project node set. 
2. those are candiate for scheudling. 
3. then identify the right node to schedule on using scheduling algarithm. 

Without scheduler the easiest way to schedule a POD is to simply set the node name field to name of the node in yoru pod speecification file .
k8s won't allow you to modify the node name property of the pod (pod already running but no node) 

You can create a binding object and do a post request to a running pod. (convert the binding object yaml to JSON format) 
if no scheduler is there, pod will be in pending state always. 

===================================================================================================

labels & selectors: 

inorder to connect the replica set to the POD we configure the selector field under the replica set specification to match the labels defined on the POD. 
Mention other labels also to make sure that right pods are discovered by the replica set. single label will do the job.
on creation if labels match the replica set is created successfully. 

annotations are used to record other details for informatory purposes. 
like tool details like name, version, build information etc or contact details or phonenumbers, email IDs etc. 
that may be used for some kind of integration purposes. 

====================================================================================================

TAINTS and Tolerations: 
consider Node A is tainted: 

1. by default PODs have no tolerations. 
2. Non of the pod can tolerate any taint. 
3. We would like to allow only pod D to be on Node A, so we add a toleration to POD D. \
4. when scheduler tries to place the pods on Node A, it goes thorough. Node A accepts the pods that tolerate the taint Blue. 

taint-effect: what would happen to the POD if they don't tolerate the taint. 
taint and tolerations are meant accept pods with tolerations only, the pod can be placed on other nodes as well as there is no taint for other nodes. 

when k8s cluster is first setup a taint is set on the master node automatically that prevents any pods from being scheduled on this node. that is why scheduler never
schedule pods on the master node.
