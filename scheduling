1. the scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for thse that dont have this project node set. 
2. those are candiate for scheudling. 
3. then identify the right node to schedule on using scheduling algarithm. 

Without scheduler the easiest way to schedule a POD is to simply set the node name field to name of the node in yoru pod speecification file .
k8s won't allow you to modify the node name property of the pod (pod already running but no node) 

You can create a binding object and do a post request to a running pod. (convert the binding object yaml to JSON format) 
if no scheduler is there, pod will be in pending state always. 

=================

labels & selectors: 

inorder to connect the replica set to the POD we configure the selector field under the replica set specification to match the labels defined on the POD. 
Mention other labels also to make sure that right pods are discovered by the replica set. single label will do the job.
on creation if labels match the replica set is created successfully. 

annotations are used to record other details for informatory purposes. 
like tool details like name, version, build information etc or contact details or phonenumbers, email IDs etc. 
that may be used for some kind of integration purposes.
