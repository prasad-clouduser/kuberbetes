1. the scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for thse that dont have this project node set. 
2. those are candiate for scheudling. 
3. then identify the right node to schedule on using scheduling algarithm. 

Without scheduler the easiest way to schedule a POD is to simply set the node name field to name of the node in yoru pod speecification file .
k8s won't allow you to modify the node name property of the pod (pod already running but no node) 

You can create a binding object and do a post request to a running pod. (convert the binding object yaml to JSON format) 
if no scheduler is there, pod will be in pending state always.
